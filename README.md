# leaflet_draw_shiny

This simple example illustrates Leaflet draw functionality within a Shiny app. Combining the [World Port Index data](https://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_62&pubCode=0015) from the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency and data on earthquakes in 2016 from a [USGS API](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/fdsnws/event/1/), draw functionality exposed in the [leaflet.extras](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/leaflet.extras/index.html) R package is illustrated in this Shiny app, which is deployed on shinyapps.io at https://mvanhala.shinyapps.io/ports-earthquakes/.
